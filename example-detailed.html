            This example demomstrates the capabilities of vanilla-cream.
            For a production environment you probably want to load some script file instead of 
            embedding this code into a html file.
            In this example the state and fetch events are managed outside the component system.
            You also might want to choose to make components to automatically intercept fetch
            and state events by passing construtor arguments to the componet base class. It is up 
            to you.

            /*
            In this example a global state is used. You might also use multiple states managed by
            individual components.
            The state is mutable! When a reference is changed all components that use this exact
            reference will update.
            State changes are propagated using DOM Events. 
            Every component is responsible for its state and might modify it. It can also dispose
            its state and subsequently itself.

            The DOM Element returned can be appended to the DOM.
            In this example the state is passed as create parameter
            You can also pass options that will be assigned to the component instance before intialization
            WebComponents cannot be instantiated using the constructor.
