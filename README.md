## Exactly, what?
Against all trends. VC is a dynamically typed OOP Framework that utilizes Web Components, prefers a imperative approach over a declarative, uses references to branches of one or more mutable states, combines the model, view and controller in a single class and last but not least, puts the focus on the client.

It is beautifully simple.


## The benefits
* Flat learning curve
* No dependencies
* Uses only standard technology
* Covers all the basic user interface development needs
* Encapsulated components and styles
* No additonal language, dialect or custom annotations
* Fast load times
* Only neccessary modules are imported dynamically
* Other Frameworks and Libraries can easily be intergrated
* Serve from source using any webserver
* Makes optimal use of the browser cache
* Unbenchmarked but sufficient performance



## Why?
Yes, there are numerous frameworks that are widely adopted, battle tested and  basically do the same job. The reason that these were written in the first place is mostly because of the state of JavaScript ten years ago. The features of the different Implementations were limited, the landscape was inconsisten and there were many compatibility issues. Furthermore, many convenience functions were missing. Tea without sugar.

I spent a lot of time fiddling with package managers, preprocessors, transpilers, bundlers and various front end frameworks. A overwhelming, everchanging toolchain.

I like the idea that the source code is delivered unchanged. In my opinion this is true Open Source. Just open the developer tools and inspect the source code of what you are viewing. The advantages of an interpreted language should be used to justify the overhead. The utilization of references also offers possibilities that do not necessarily have to be thrown overboard by treating everything as unmutable. Then there is the topic of the MVC design pattern. I prefer to think about this on a large scale. Database, client and server.
